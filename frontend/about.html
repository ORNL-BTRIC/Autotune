						About Autotune
					</h1>
					
					<p> 
						The major barriers to DOE's Building Technology Program (BTP) goals and the adoption of building energy modeling software are the user expertise, time, and associated costs required to develop a software model that accurately reflects reality. Typically, a building modeler uses the software tool they have most experience with to create the geometry of a building, layer it with detailed material properties, add equipment with anticipated operational schedules and run the simulation.
						Heavily instrumented ZEBRAlliance houses
						An E+ building model can easily have 3,000+ inputs for a normal residential building with very specific details that most energy modelers do not have data for. The goal of the Autotune project is to save the time building modelers spend tweaking building input parameters to match ground-truth data by providing an "autotune" easy button for a standard desktop computer which intelligently adjusts model inputs.
